Gel Properties Analysis Project

Overview
This project explores the relationship between nanoscale and mesoscale properties of gels and their rheological behavior using data science techniques. 
By applying multiple machine learning models, including multilinear regression, neural networks, and clustering, this analysis aims to uncover patterns and predictive relationships in simulated gel data.

Objectives
- Analyze the impact of nanoscale and mesoscale structural features on gel rheology.
- Build and compare different models to predict rheological properties.

Methods
Data Simulation: Generation of synthetic data representing gel structures and their mechanical properties.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends and distributions.
Multilinear Regression: Understanding linear dependencies between variables.
Neural Networks: Capturing complex, nonlinear relationships.
Clustering: Identifying natural groupings within gel property data.
Model Evaluation: Comparing model performance using appropriate metrics.
